# distribution

This is the distribution library. 

## Environment Setup

We recommend using the prepared [container image](https://github.com/brown-cs1380/container).

## Installation

After you have setup your environment, you can start using the distribution library.
When loaded, distribution introduces functionality supporting the distributed execution of programs. To download it:

```sh
$ npm i '@brown-ds/distribution'
```

This command downloads and installs the distribution library.

## Testing

There are several categories of tests:
  *	Regular Tests (`*.test.js`)
  *	Scenario Tests (`*.scenario.js`)
  *	Extra Credit Tests (`*.extra.test.js`)
  * Student Tests (`*.student.test.js`) - inside `test/test-student`

### Running Tests

By default, all regular tests are run. Use the options below to run different sets of tests:

1. Run all regular tests (default): `$ npm test` or `$ npm test -- -t`
2. Run scenario tests: `$ npm test -- -c` 
3. Run extra credit tests: `$ npm test -- -ec`
4. Run the `non-distribution` tests: `$ npm test -- -nd`
5. Combine options: `$ npm test -- -c -ec -nd -t`

## Usage

To try out the distribution library inside an interactive Node.js session, run:

```sh
$ node
```

Then, load the distribution library:

```js
> let distribution = require("@brown-ds/distribution")();
> distribution.node.start(console.log);
```

Now you have access to the full distribution library. You can start off by serializing some values. 

```js
> s = distribution.util.serialize(1); // '{"type":"number","value":"1"}'
> n = distribution.util.deserialize(s); // 1
```

You can inspect information about the current node (for example its `sid`) by running:

```js
> distribution.local.status.get('sid', console.log); // null 8cf1b (null here is the error value; meaning there is no error)
```

You can also store and retrieve values from the local memory:

```js
> distribution.local.mem.put({name: 'nikos'}, 'key', console.log); // null {name: 'nikos'} (again, null is the error value) 
> distribution.local.mem.get('key', console.log); // null {name: 'nikos'}

> distribution.local.mem.get('wrong-key', console.log); // Error('Key not found') undefined
```

You can also spawn a new node:

```js
> node = { ip: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080 };
> distribution.local.status.spawn(node, console.log);
```

Using the `distribution.all` set of services will allow you to act 
on the full set of nodes created as if they were a single one.

```js
> distribution.all.status.get('sid', console.log); // {} { '8cf1b': '8cf1b', '8cf1c': '8cf1c' } (now, errors are per-node and form an object)
```

You can also send messages to other nodes:

```js
> distribution.local.comm.send(['sid'], {node: node, service: 'status', method: 'get'}, console.log); // null 8cf1c
```

Most methods in the distribution library are asynchronous and take a callback as their last argument.
This callback is called when the method completes, with the first argument being an error (if any) and the second argument being the result.
If you wanted to run this same sequence of commands in a script, you could do something like this (note the nested callbacks):

```js
let distribution = require("@brown-ds/distribution")();
// Now we're only doing a few of the things we did above
const out = (cb) => {
  distribution.local.status.stop(cb); // Shut down the local node
};
distribution.node.start(() => {
  // This will run only after the node has started
  const node = {ip: '127.0.0.1', port: 8765};
  distribution.local.status.spawn(node, (e, v) => {
    if (e) {
      return out(console.log);
    }
    // This will run only after the new node has been spawned
    distribution.all.status.get('sid', (e, v) => {
      // This will run only after we communicated with all nodes and got their sids
      console.log(v); // { '8cf1b': '8cf1b', '8cf1c': '8cf1c' }
      // Shut down the remote node
      distribution.local.comm.send([], {service: 'status', method: 'stop', node: node}, () => {
        // Finally, stop the local node
        out(console.log); // null, {ip: '127.0.0.1', port: 1380}
      });
    });
  });
});
```

# Results and Reflections

# M1: Serialization / Deserialization
## Summary
> Summarize your implementation, including key challenges you encountered. Remember to update the `report` section of the `package.json` file with the total number of hours it took you to complete each task of M1 (`hours`) and the lines of code per task.
My implementation comprises 2 software components, totaling 219 lines of code. Key challenges included test cases for latency, intial design for serialization/deserialization, and lastly error handling. The first challenge was the initial design for the serilization and deserilization was difficult to garsp, for exmaple I could have just coped off how it was structured in the library {type: type, value: val}. However, since I built my implemetation around using the JSON.stringfy I chose that instead of adding the type for every primivitive and basic thing that JSON can already do, we only need to add the type for the things JSON cant do, like Date objects and (simplier) NaN. This way the string becomes {"__type":"nan"}. This was simple and we didnt need to add extra deserilization steps for the primivitives (I first wrote out what each string looked like then wrote the code for how it is serilized). Secondly, the next problem was actaully understanding hwo to wrote the latency calculation code, but this was ismple after writing once you could just copy and paste it. Error handling and objects were pain, since I had to rewrite how deserilized (mainly JSON.parse) worked. It was weird because we coudlnt just do the reverse of serialize one to one because when yo run JSON.parse it doesn't have info about its parents node (which conatin the iso value) so I wrote another function that lest JSON.parse completely finish then we go back in and revist how the __type shoudl be handled. 
## Correctness & Performance Characterization
> Describe how you characterized the correctness and performance of your implementation
*Correctness*: I wrote 5 tests; these tests take 1.8secs to execute. This includes objects with literally everything, like nested structures, arrays, base types (strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined), special numbers (NaN, Infinity, -Infinity), functions, Dates, and Errors.
*Performance*: The latency of various subsystems is described in the `"latency"` portion of package.json. The characteristics of my development machines are summarized in the `"dev"` portion of package.json.
